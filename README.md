# example_extended_bloc

A project intended to demonstrate various ways blocs can be extended and
manipulated. This project in no way makes any strong recommendations of how the
the inheritance hierarchy of a project making use of flutter bloc should be
orchestrated, but rather attempts to provide guide of a few ways in which it may
be achieved.

This project is primarily a playground and there are most likely mistakes and
room for further discoveries and refinement. The techniques demonstrated are
unlikely to be the only methods of how blocs may be extended and used.
